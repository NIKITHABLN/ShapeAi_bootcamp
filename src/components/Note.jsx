        Hi, I made this project during the 7 days free BOotcamp,conducted by
        <b> SHAPEAI</b>.The instructor during the session was Mr.Shaurya
        Sinha(Data Anayst Intern at Jio).I got to learn a lot during these 7
        days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.<br></br>
        Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well.<br></br>{" "}

        <br></br> I got to have hands on experience on:<li>Javascript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>React.js</li>During these 7 days, and everything was explained from
        the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can
        learn.I enjoyed these 7days,you can as well.To register for next free
